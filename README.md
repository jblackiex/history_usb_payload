# history_usb_payload

### 🛠️ How it works

 -- > This payload is meant to exfiltrate public ip address and bash history to a Discord Webhook Server. You need a rubber-ducky or Raspberry-pi Pico to test the script.

Opens a shell, sends the public IP address of the target machine to a Discord WebHook, creates a bash script, runs the bash script in the background mode using ```&``` and sends history commands to the same Discord webhook, one line at a time. It's a simple project that helps me gain knowledge of payloads and cybersecurity in general. As of now, it works only with Linux devices having US or UK keyboard layouts.

#### Italian keyboard layout is coming soon..
